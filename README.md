# Trillo React Travel App

This project is a demo app that recreates and extends Jonas Schmedtmann's Trillo project with React.

## Overview

Jonas Schmedtmann's Trillo page is a static webpage built using HTML and SCSS. It serves as a demo in his advanced CSS course.

This project sought to rebuild Jonas' project in React, thus giving it more functionality.

The styling and layout from Jonas' project are kept with modifications:

- Colors are changed from tones of pink to blue and gold
- Nav items use React Router to display different pages
- The user menu item now has a hover dropdown menu
- UseState is used to display conditional content based on the active page

Ideas for future improvements:

- Fleshing out and styling 'welcome' and other pages
- Managing state with Redux
- Creating a dummy database in Firebase to store additional hotels
